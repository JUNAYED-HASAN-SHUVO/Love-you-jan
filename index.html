                From the moment I saw you, I felt something I’ve never felt before.  
                You are the sunshine that lights up my world, the melody that makes my heart dance.  
                <br><br>
                I want to spend my life making you smile, being your strength, and holding your hand through every moment.  
                You complete me, and I can’t imagine my world without you in it.  
                <br><br>
                Will you allow me to be the one who makes your life as beautiful as you’ve made mine?  
                <br><br>
                You are my dream, my heart, my everything.  
                I love you more than words can ever express.
