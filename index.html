            From the moment I met you, my heart knew it had found its other half. 
            <br><br>
            You make my world brighter, my days happier, and my soul calmer. I can't imagine life without your presence, your smile, your laugh. 
            <br><br>
            I want to spend every moment cherishing you, supporting you, and making you feel like the most special person in the world because you are.
            <br><br>
            Will you be the reason for my forever happiness? Will you make my dreams come true by being by my side, not just today, but always? 
            <br><br>
            My heart, my soul, and everything I am belongs to you.
